/// A GeoJson object with TYPE [GeoJsonType.geometryCollection] is a Geometry
/// object.
///
/// Unlike the other geometry types, a [GeometryCollection] can be a
/// heterogeneous composition of smaller [Geometry] objects. For example, a
/// [Geometry] object in the shape of a lowercase roman "i" can be composed of
/// one point and one [LineString].
///
/// [GeometryCollections] have a different syntax from single type Geometry
/// objects ([Point], [LineString], and [Polygon]) and homogeneously typed
/// multipart [Geometry] objects ([MultiPoint], [MultiLineString],
/// and [MultiPolygon]) but have no different semantics.
///
/// Although a [GeometryCollection] object has no [coordinates] member, it does
/// have coordinates: the coordinates of all its parts belong to the collection.
///
/// The [geometries] member of a [GeometryCollection] describes the parts of
/// this composition. Implementations SHOULD NOT apply any additional semantics
/// to the [geometries] array.
///
/// To maximize interoperability, implementations SHOULD avoid nested
/// [GeometryCollection]s. Furthermore, [GeometryCollection]s composed of a
/// single part or a number of parts of a single type SHOULD be avoided when
/// that single part or a single object of multipart TYPE ([MultiPoint],
/// [MultiLineString], or [MultiPolygon]) could be used instead.
///
/// An example of a serialized [GeometryCollection]s given below:
/// ```json
/// {
///   "type": "GeometryCollection",
///   "geometries": [{
///     "type": "Point",
///     "coordinates": [100.0, 0.0]
///   }, {
///     "type": "LineString",
///     "coordinates": [
///       [101.0, 0.0],
///       [102.0, 1.0]
///     ]
///   }]
/// }
/// ```
